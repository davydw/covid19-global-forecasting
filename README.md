# covid19-global-forecasting

Since the beginning of the epidemic, it's been sometimes difficult to decode the spread of the coronavirus, and its numbers. What do they really tell us? Let's start from the beginning.

**November 17, 2019**

In China, a first case of a breathing illness is identified in a 55-year-old patient.

**December 15**

27 cases are listed in China.

**December 20**

The number of cases is now 60. The sick are tested for 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. All the results became negative. This is a new contagious illness, baptized since then Covid-19, carried by the SARS-Cov2 virus, a coronavirus type.

**January 2020**

From January 21, 2020, the World Organization Health (WHO) publish every day numbers giving a number of patients and death, country by country. But beware, the number of reported cases don't give the number sick people, nor that of infected people. These are not estimates. This is just the count confirmed cases and diagnosed with the disease, who have been the subject of a specific declaration to WHO. Therefore, they depend on the capacities detection logistics, variables from one country to another, and national policies who determine which groups must be tested between the general population, people who have symptoms, health workers, hospitalized people.
In addition, coronavirus causes more or less severe symptoms, even no symptoms. The number of people infected is therefore much more important than the published figures. The exact number of carriers of the Sars Cov 2 is actually unknown.

**End of March**

We now have an overview of the spread of the coronavirus and the number of deaths by the covid-19. Strangely, we found out that the ratio between the number of reported cases and the number of deaths is very variable from one country to another.

How can we explain the difference between Germany, France, Italy and Spain? Does that mean that the coronavirus is less deadly from one country to another? The answer is 'No'. This difference in numbers is actually based on 3 parameters:
- Each country has its own way to count cases;
- Health systems are more or less functional;
- It all depends on *when* the country is affected by coronavirus, because the increase in deaths is a few weeks late on the increase of reported cases.

So let's go further in the visualization of the data. By looking cumulative data, on a day by day and country by country basis, the number of new cases reported and new deaths, we can see a mismatch between the increase the number of cases and the increase in deaths for all affected countries. Therefore, it makes no sense to compare the situation of 2 countries for the same day, when they have not been reached at the same time.

It is also this delay that allows to explain why in Italy, there may have been a sharp increase in deaths at the end of March, while the number new cases stabilizes.

But this visualization allows also to read something else. Even if the numbers, supplied by china are to take with caution we still see that containment measures, taken from January 22, start to have an effect few weeks later. And at the end of March, it seems that the epidemic was under control there.

Following China, several European countries and the world have taken steps to containment of their population. Beginning of April 2020, more than 3 billion people were bound to containment or to limitations of displacement. But it will not be possible to see the effects on the numbers only after a period of Several weeks. The data collected during the pandemic will ask to be analyzed and completed once the coronavirus will be defeated.

Only one thing is certain in these figures: **in less than 4 months, the Covid-19 changed the world.**
